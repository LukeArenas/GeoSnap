### ***Back-end Decisions***

I decided to use Postgres and Express for the back-end because I find they have a good balance between structure and flexibility.

### ***Front-end Decisions***

React and Node suit my front-end needs through their component hierarchy. The redux functionality paired with React will help keep my project organized and scalable.
